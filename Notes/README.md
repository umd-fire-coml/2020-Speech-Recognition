### [Survey on Deep Neural Networks in Speech and Vision Systems](Survey_on_Deep_Neural_Networks_in_Speech_and_Vision_Systems.pdf)

[Original Link Here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07656)
This paper surveys various DNNs for Speech and Vision applications. Alam et al. list and describe various techniques that have been recently employed for deep neural networks. For the purpose of our project, they list several models that would be worth exploring; Section 2.6 on Generative Models For Speech, 2.7 on Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTMs, and 2.8 on Attention Neural Networks seem to be the most relevant. The discussion in Section 3.2 covers these models in a little more depth and lists many papers and models that we could refer to in future research. This paper also surveys models that have resource constraints and are made to be more lightweight; although this seems to be outside the scope of our current research, it could be worth considering in the future. 

### [A Neural Conversational Model](A_Neural_Conversational_Model)

This paper proposed a novel conversational model that was based on the Seq2Seq model. The researchers used the seq2seq framework to predict the next sentence given the previous sentence or sentences in a conversation. They showed that their model was able to hold simple conversation with detailed responses when given a dataset of an IT Helpdesk, and less detailed but mostly logically correct responses when shown a more open-domain dataset of movie transcripts.

### [Neural Approaches to Conversational AI](Neural_Approaches_to_Conversational_AI.pdf)

[Original Link here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08267)
This paper is a very extensive study and summary of using Neural Networks for Coversational AI. It is 95 pages long and has not been read extensively, but it may prove to be useful in the future if we choose to go along this path.
