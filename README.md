Text overlay and subtitle generation. Aim to transcribe an audio or video file and in multiple languages through reliable and fast methods

## Information and method: 

The process for transcription is time consuming and requires a lot of educated people with language profciency. This effort is compounded when a multi-language 
transcript is required. Natural language processing (NLP) and translation are some of the hardest problems for computers to solve because of the many idiomatic elements
of speech. This requires a native speaker of both the source and target language to perform a translation. 
The recently introduced neural-network based approach to machine translation has brought on unprecedented translation 
accuracy and fluency. While it is not perfect yet, it is now a viable solution for many more use cases than ever before.

* Step 1: Recognise Speech in audio or video files.
* Step 2: Storing the output in JSON file that includes word-level time stamping, punctiation and confidence levels.
* Step 3: Converting to relevant sub title file format. For example .SRT file.
* Step 4: Overlaying it on video or audio files with media player or online tools. 

Other steps may include language conversion using Neural Machine Translation[NMT].
